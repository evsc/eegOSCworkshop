To receive and decode data over bluetooth run the openFrameworks app [thinkgear_broadcast](https://github.com/evsc/eegOSCworkshop/tree/master/thinkgear_broadcast) (requires [ofxThinkgear addon](https://github.com/evsc/ofxThinkgear)). The outgoing OSC data is meant to be received by the [eeg\_broadcast\_1](https://github.com/evsc/eegOSCworkshop/tree/master/broadcaster/_oldbroadcasters/eeg_broadcast_1) processing app, from where you could broadcast data from all 3 EEG sensors simultaneously. <p align="center">	<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evsc/eegOSCworkshop/master/presentation/img/thinkgear_broadcast.PNG"/></p>## ThinkGear Setup (Ubuntu 14)### Bluetooth connectionFigure out your device's mac address by connecting to it with the Bluetooth New Device Setup.  Initial mapping of bluetooth device to serial port, see http://askubuntu.com/questions/248817/how-to-i-connect-a-raw-serial-terminal-to-a-bluetooth-connection	$ sudo nano /etc/bluetooth/rfcomm.conf 	rfcomm0 {		bind no;		device XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX;		channel	1;		comment "brainbandxl_bluetooth";	}Establishing pairing to bluetooth device with the Bluetooth menu. Then map the bluetooth data to the serial port with 	$ sudo rfcomm connect 0should print out (while blinking of LED should have slowed down)	Connected /dev/rfcomm0 to XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX on channel 1	Press CTRL-C for hangupIf it says		Can't connect RFCOMM socket: Host is downthen try toggeling the sensor unit on and off, and/or toggeling your computer's bluetooth on and off. If it says	Can't create RFCOMM TTY: Address already in usestop the app and try to reconnect#### ScreenVerify that serial data is coming in (should print out a bunch of unencoded jibberish)	$ sudo screen /dev/rfcomm0Note, both screen and OF app need to be run with sudo, in order to read serial data from the port. ### Hardware ResetIn case of emergencies, these are the steps to do a hardware reset on the sensor unit:* Plug in USB: light should go on solid* Hold down button for 5 seconds so it is flashing* Press twice* Press again and hold until light goes off (~ 7 sec)* Unplug from USB, and plug back in
