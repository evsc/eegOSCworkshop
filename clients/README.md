In order to receives messages from the OSC server, they need to send a `/eeg/connect` message first. ```OUTGOING OSC MESSAGES# register the own IP address at the OSC server/eeg/connect# sign off again/eeg/disconnect```      The messages that can be received by the clients, are:```INCOMING OSC MESSAGES# state of charge of battery, message frequency 0.1Hz/batt i# if sensor is touching the forehead or not, message frequency 10Hz/forehead i# status indicator for sensors, 1=good, 2=ok, 4=bad, message frequency 10Hz/horseshoe iiii# frequency bands - relative values (0-1.0), message frequency 10Hz/delta f/theta f/alpha f/beta f/gamma f# detection of muscle movement: blink, 1=detected, message frequency 10Hz/blink i```
