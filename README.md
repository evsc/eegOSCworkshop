## OSC messages

### muse
The Muse headband has 4 sensors, the values are communicated in the order: (1) left ear (2) left forehead (3) right forehead (4) right ear. 

	# EEG of 4 sensors, in microvolt range 0-1682.0
	/muse/eeg ffff
	# multiply eeg value with quantization value to get uncompressed value
	/muse/eeg/quantization iiii
	# accelerometer values (1) forward/backward (2) up/down (3) left/right, range: -2000 to 1996 mg
	/muse/acc fff

## ThinkGear EEG

Myndplay BrainBandXL

EEG headset, soft headband with 2 dry sensor contact points (1 single sensor) and an ear clip. Runs with ThinkGear chip, 10 hour battery, Bluetooth 4.0 up to 30m range ([Blue Creation BC127](http://www.bluecreation.com/product_info.php?products_id=38)), 512Hz sampling rate.


EEG frequency bands  

* delta (0.5 - 2.75Hz)
* theta (3.5 - 6.75Hz)
* low-alpha (7.5 - 9.25Hz)
* high-alpha (10 - 11.75Hz)
* low-beta (13 - 16.75Hz)
* high-beta (18 - 29.75Hz)
* low-gamma (31 - 39.75Hz)
* mid-gamma (41 - 49.75Hz)


Interpretive data

* Attention (focus, concentration)
* Meditation (relaxation)
* eyeblink detection (only when access via ThinkGearConnector driver)



# Setup (Ubuntu 14)

## ThinkGear

### Bluetooth connection

Figure out your device's mac address by connecting to it with the Bluetooth New Device Setup.  

Initial mapping of bluetooth device to serial port, see http://askubuntu.com/questions/248817/how-to-i-connect-a-raw-serial-terminal-to-a-bluetooth-connection

	$ sudo nano /etc/bluetooth/rfcomm.conf 

	rfcomm0 {
		bind no;
		device XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX;
		channel	1;
		comment "brainbandxl_bluetooth";
	}

Establishing pairing to bluetooth device with the Bluetooth menu. Then map the bluetooth data to the serial port with 

	$ sudo rfcomm connect 0


should print out (while blinking of LED should have slowed down)

	Connected /dev/rfcomm0 to XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX on channel 1
	Press CTRL-C for hangup

If it says
	
	Can't connect RFCOMM socket: Host is down

then try toggeling the sensor unit on and off, and/or toggeling your computer's bluetooth on and off. 

If it says

	Can't create RFCOMM TTY: Address already in use

stop the app and try to reconnect


#### Screen

Verify that serial data is coming in (should print out a bunch of unencoded jibberish)

	$ sudo screen /dev/rfcomm0

Note, both screen and OF app need to be run with sudo, in order to read serial data from the port. 




### Hardware Reset

In case of emergencies, these are the steps to do a hardware reset on the sensor unit:

* Plug in USB: light should go on solid
* Hold down button for 5 seconds so it is flashing
* Press twice
* Press again and hold until light goes off (~ 7 sec)
* Unplug from USB, and plug back in
