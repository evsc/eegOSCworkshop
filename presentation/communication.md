# What is bluetooth?

Signal

 * short-wavelength UHF (ultra high frequencey) radio waves in the [ISM band](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISM_band) from 2.4 to 2.485 GHz
 * only for short distances, operating range depends on the device class

Protocol

 * there are 79 designated Bluetooth channels, with 1 MHz bandwidth (from 2402 to 2480 MHz), Bluetooth 4.0 uses 2 MHz spacing which allows for 40 channels
 * uses a radio technology called frequency-hopping spread spectrum (pseudorandom switching between frequency channels), 1600 hops per second
 * master-slave protocol
 * can connect several devices (max 7)
 * Bluetooth enabled devices connect together to for a personal area network (PAN)
