## Electricity on my mind

Electrical activity in the form of nerve impulses. 100 billion neurons.

## EEG History

| year | history |
| ------- | ------- |
| **1875, 1890** | EEG activity of animals  |
| **1924** | first human EEG, Hans Berger named EEG  |
| **1937** | stages of sleep  |

## Brainwaves

An EEG electrode detects the electrical activity from thousands of neurons underneath its sensor. One square millimeter of cortex has more than 100,000 neurons. The amplitudes recorded by scalp electrodes are in the range of microvolts. When a lot of them fire in near-synchrony, a rhythm can be detected. 

Amplitude and frequency are the primary characteristics of brain waves. The more neurons that work in synchrony, the larger the potential (amplitude) of the electrical oscillations measu­red in microvolts. The faster the neurons work together, the higher the frequency of the oscilla­tions measured in Hertz.

| WAVE | FREQ | STATE | AMPLITUDE | 
| ------- | ------- | ------- |------- |
| **GAMMA** | 30-120 Hz | hyper active, high energy state, ecstasy  | |
| **BETA** | 14-30 Hz | active thinking, alert | 5-10 uV |
| **ALPHA** | 7-14 Hz | idle state, relaxed focus, meditation, eyes closed | 20-200 uV |
| **THETA** | 4-7 Hz | drowsy, dreams, trance states | 10 uV |
| **DELTA** | < 4 Hz | dreamless sleep, coma | 20-200 uV |

## Measuring the Brain

Other methods for measuring the brain might be more exact, but are usually bigger, heavier, scarier and more expensive. 

| Short | Full Name | Technique | Temporal resolution | Spatial resolution | Pro | Con |
| ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | 
| **CT** | X-Ray Computed Tomography | dense objects (bones) block x-rays |  |  | rapid, noninvasive | radiation exposure |
| **PET** | Position Emission Tomography | measures blood flow with ingested/injected radioisotopes | >10s | 10mm |  | expensive, minor radiation exposure |
| **MRI / fMRI** | (Functional) Magnetic Resonance Imaging | measures blood flow changes | ~2-3s | ~5mm | noninvasive, good spatial resolution | expensive |
| **MEG** | Magneto Encephalo Graphy | measures magnetic field produced by brain activity | 0.01s | 10mm | noninvasive | expensive, requires room of shielding |
| **fNIRS** | Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy | scattered near-infrared light | ~1s | ~20mm | noninvasive| low resolution (space, time), surface of cortex only |
| **EEG** | Electroencaphalogram | measures electrical brain wave activity on outer layer of brain | `0.01s | ~20mm | inexpensive, noninvasive, portable | poor spatial resolution, limited to outer layer |
|  | Invasive Sensors | microarrays, neurochips, ECoG, ... |

## Sensors

 * dry (pin sensors, or conductive foam)
 * wet (conductive paste)
 * epidermal electronics 

A electrode always needs at least a second electrode as a reference signal, so it can measure the difference in electrical potential (voltage) between their two positions. An electrode on the earlobe acts as a point of reference, ‘ground’, of the body’s baseline voltage due to other electrical activities within the body.

### 10-20 System

Electrode positions have been named according to the brain region below the area of the scalp: frontal, central (sulcus), parietal, temporal, and occipital. 

 * 19 recording electrodes
 * 1 ground
 * 1 system reference

## Data acquisition

### Hardware: Circuitry

 1. Electrode and Reference
 2. Differential amplifier
 3. Amplifier
 4. 50/60 Hertz Filter
 5. Analog Digital Conversion (sampling at: 256-512 Hz, up to 20kHz)

### Software: Signal Processing

 * FFT frequency analysis



## Watch out!

 * Variability! signals are different for every person
 * Variability! placement of sensors
 * Variability! brain dynamics constantly change
 * Signal-to-noise ratio very noisy!
 * Redundancy: all channels almost record the same signal
 * Calibration needed: record a baseline first







# Using EEG data

## EEG in Neurological Diagnostic

 * Epilepsy
 * Coma
 * Brain death
 * Brain dysfunctions
 * Sleep research
 * Sleep disorders
 * Anesthesia

## Types of BCI

| Type | what | example |
| ----- | ---- |---- |
| **Active BCI** | derives its outputs from brain activity which is consciously controlled by the user | |
| **Reactive BCI** | derives its outputs from brain activity arising in reaction to external stimulation, which is indirectly modulated by the user for controlling an application | |
| **Passive BCI** | derives its outputs from arbitrary brain activity without the purpose of voluntary control, for enriching a human-computer interaction with implicit information | |

## What can you measure?

| Class | what |
| ----- | ---- |
| Tonic state | slow changing brain processes: degree of relaxation, stress level, ... |
| Phasic State | fast states, switching attention, imagining movement .. |
| Event-related state | rely on presence of event: surprised/not surprised, committed error ... |
